        I’ve been building and shipping mobile applications with a focus on intuitive design, performance, and reliability. Over the years, I’ve contributed to projects of varying scale — from lightweight apps to complex systems — and collaborated with teams of all sizes, including cross-squad coordination in larger environments. Along the way, I’ve also deepened my knowledge through hands-on learning and structured training programs.
